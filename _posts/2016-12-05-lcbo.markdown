description: The existing app was a hybrid app. Our team at Symbility Intersect got down and hammered out a beautiful new experience, from the ground up, in <b>one month</b>. My involvement was spearheading the iOS front, along with guiding the Android team toward success, while maintaining goals and project expectations with the client. A fun project, built purely in Swift.

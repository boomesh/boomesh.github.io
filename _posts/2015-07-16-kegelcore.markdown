description: The product was intended to aid women with weak pelvic walls, and help train and strengthen their kegel muscles via an intensive and rewarding training regime. The premise is to monitor a user's pressure in over squeeze-hold successions via a biotelemetry device, which then through bluetooth communicated to the app on their mobile device. Offline-mode, pressure changes due to temperature, as well as the various nuances that come with bluetooth were the main obstacles I had encountered as an engineer.

description: The product was intended to aid women with weak pelvic walls by strengthening their kegel muscles through an intensive, yet rewarding training regime. After a workout, the pressure readings retrieved through bluetooth from a biotelemetry device is evaluated in the app. Using server-controlled rulesets users are informed of a successful level-up or new achievements. Offline-mode, pressure changes due to temperature, as well as the various nuances that come with bluetooth were the main obstacles I had encountered as an Android engineer.

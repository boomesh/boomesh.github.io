description: For a short time, a few colleagues and myself were resourced as engineers on various Zynga With Friends games. As the android engineer resource, I worked on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.scramble">Word Streak</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.chess.googleplay">Chess</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.hanging">Hanging</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.matching">Matching</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.gems.googleplay">Gems</a> With Friends. We spent a good amount of time cleaning up code, optimizing various areas of the games, and migrated local datastores due to various third party dependencies requiring upgrades.
